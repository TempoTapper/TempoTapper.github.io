            <p>This week our team worked on our second formal presentation of the term the final design presentation
                The FDP was much more in depth than our PDP and therefore we had to spend a little bit more time on this one.

                We started by restating all the important factors from our first presentation such as problem statement, specifications, and constraints.
                The bulk of this presentation was talking about our detailed design for our selected design.
                From a hardware perspective we discussed sensor selection, circuitry design, mechanical design and showed some pictures of our CAD.
                For software we presented our page designs, talked about the various algorithms we were planning on using and about how we were doing communication between the device and application.

                decided to be split into three components: the finger sleeves, connectors, and wrist mount. The connectors were added during this phase to ensure that the device was modular and easy to assemble

            <p>Our team focused on software architecture this week...</p>

            <p>We picked our software tech stack after careful evaluation, and this is summarized in the tables below</p>

                <img src="./language_matrix.png" alt="">
            </div>

            <p>We then started coming up with the flowchart for the application flow, and the final flowchart is shown below</p>

            
            <div class="center-img">
                <img src="./flow_chart.png" alt="">
            </div>

            <p>We also created some preliminary designs for our various application pages shown below</p>
            <div class="center-img">
                <img src="./loginportal.png" alt="">

                <img src="./analysis.png" alt="">
            </div>

            <p>Another important aspect to consider was how we were transferring the data from the device to the application. And to do that we will be using a node.js server to read data that is written to the serial port by the arduino. The node.js server will then communicate with the Front-end of our application through a websocket so that it can be displayed for the user. We will be using NPM packages like "serialport" and "socket.io" to make this communication simple and seemless.</p>

            <p>The first phase was figuring what components were needed. These components ended up being: Finger Sleeves, a Microcontroller, a Microcontroller mount, Different sensors (touch sensors), and a Power Source. </p>

            <p>  <b>Finger sleeves:</b> research was done to figure out the ideal sizing and dimension for the sleeves as well as what fabric or material would be ideal. </p>
                
                <p>  <b>Microcontroller: </b> During this week numerous Microcontrollers were investigated based on how well they met our project constraints and criteria with the main factors being size (since this is a weable), number of IO pins, and power consumption.  </p>
                
                    <p>     <b>The Microcontroller Mount: </b>during this phase, the mount itself was not designed, but was just decided to be a component of our device. More specifically, it was decided to be a wrist mount to help keep the ROM of users at a maximum.  </p>
                
                        <p>  <b> Different Sensors: </b> Analysis was done on different touch sensors that would be useful for this device. The touch sensor that was chosen was the piezoelectric touch sensor. </p>

            <h2>Week 4: Conceptual Designs, Patent Search and Design Selection</h2>
            <i style="color: white; margin-right: 5px" class="fas fa-calendar"></i>
            <time datetime="2023-09-11">Oct 2-8, 2023</time>
            <p>This week our team focused on coming up with conceptual designs. We came up with four designs and they are shown
                in the figure below
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Design 1: A flat pad that has pressure sensors layed out in the shape of a hand, where each pressure sensor 
                        lines up with the tips of your fingers. The device records various pieces of information including if its
                         pressed, and the duration, which can be converted into various musical concepts like key and rhythm using 
                         our software</li>
                <li>Design 2: A similar approach to design #1, except that it is shaped like a computer
                     mouse, which leaves your hand in a ball shape, which feels more normal and ergonomic</li>
                <li>Design 3: This design consists of sleeves that are worn over each finger. The sleeves have 
                    touch sensitive pads as well, allowing the user to assume whatever position they feel most 
                        comfortable in when using the device.</li>
                <li>Design 4: Use VR or AR to detect finger movements and map those to inputs</li>
            </ul>


            <div class="center-img">
                <img style="width: 50%" src="./conceptual_designs.png" alt="">
            </div>

            <p>The software component was similar across all designs, and would look something as follows:
            </p>

                <img src="./software_1.png" alt="">
            </div>


            <p>To help us choose which design was best, a design selection criteria table was assembled. This table
                contained a list of all the relevant criteria and constraints to the designs that could be compared against each design.
                This table is shown below:
            </p>

            </div>
            
            <p>Patent searches were also conducted this week, to verify that the designs could be produced, while researching patentability.
               3 patents were analyzed that were similar in nature to our problem, and their merits and demerits were compliled.
            </p>

            <p>To help us decide on a specific design, we made a decision matrix comparing the designs against each other
                with respect to the criteria and constraints. This is shown below: </p>

            <p>In week 3, our team focused on clearly defining our goals and objectives for the problem. 
                After interpreting all the data we gathered, we came up with the following goal:

                students to practice their musical rhythm/tempo while obtaining objective feedback.                 
                The solution should include a physical device capable of tracking hand/finger movements, 
                analyzing the rhythm/tempo with respect to the input, and returning the objective feedback via software interface."</p>

                <p>From the goal, we designed the following criteria and Constraints:</p>

            <p>In the second week, our team focused on gathering data and asking questions to better focus on the need.
                We interview music professors, students, and friends asking them various questions relating to learning rhythm.</p>
            <p>Some of the responses included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Having an objective form of feedback would be great for learning different rhythms</li>
                <li>Could be used in classrooms as a visual aid to learning rhythm and a more interactive approach</li>
                <li>Could have use cases for converting gestures into music</li>
                <li>Could have use cases as a more ergonomic way to generate MIDI patterns.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After interviewing a few professors who teach topics ranging from music interpretation to music theory, 
                it is clear that a device like this is not currently used in classrooms, and that it would accelerate 
                learning and improvement.</p>

            <h2>Week 1: Problem Formulation</h2>
            <i style="color: white; margin-right: 5px" class="fas fa-calendar"></i>
            <time datetime="2023-09-11">Sep 11-17, 2023</time>
            <p>During the first week, our team was focused on honing in on a specific problem and ensuring there was a problem to solve.
               We initially had multiple potential ideas, but through meeting with professors, we were able to hone in and choose one.
               Through our initial research and experience, we found that there was area for improvement in teaching students rhythm. 
                We researched the problem more, and ultimately came up with the following problem:
            </p>

            <p>
                "There is a need for a cheaper, more ergonomic, and interactive solution for music students to learn rhythm/tempo that includes
                 a form of objective feedback. ​Currently, most of the learning feedback relies on the music instructor's own judgment for 
                determining if they are correct".
             </p>

             <p>
                During the problem formulation's intial states, our group had some issues focusing specifically on the need and target audience,
                and this was to be addressed in the following week. 
             </p>
